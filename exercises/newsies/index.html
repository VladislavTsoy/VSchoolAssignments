                <h2>Back on Top, Yankees Add a 27th Title</h2>

                <p>A sliver of time for other teams is an epoch for the Yankees, who define themselves by championships. For eight seasons, they led the majors in victories, payroll and drama. They built a ballpark, created a network and expanded their brand around the globe. But they did not win the World Series.  
                    Now they have done it. There is a 27th jewel in the Yankees’ crown and a peaceful, easy feeling across their empire. The Yankees captured their first title since 2000, humbling the defending champion Philadelphia Phillies on Wednesday, 7-3, in Game 6 of the World Series at Yankee Stadium.

                <h2>After Setbacks, Small Successes for Gene Therapy</h2>
                <h5><strong>By GINA KOLATA</strong> NOV. 5, 2009 </h5>

                <p>Not long ago, gene therapy seemed troubled by insurmountable difficulties. After decades of hype and dashed hopes, many who once embraced the idea of correcting genetic disorders by giving people new genes all but gave up the idea.
                    But scientists say gene therapy may be on the edge of a resurgence. There were three recent, though small, successes — one involving children with a fatal brain disease, one with an eye disease that causes blindness and one with children who have a disease that destroys the immune system.  
                    “We are ready to move,” said Dr. Luigi Naldini of the Institute for Gene Therapy at Vita-Salute San Raffaele University in Milan.
                    Dr. Kenneth Cornetta, a gene therapy researcher at Indiana University and president of the American Society of Gene and Cell Therapy, added: “It’s exciting. The science gets better every year.”

                <h2>Apples, apples, apples</h2>
                <h5><strong>By VERLYN KLINKENBORG</strong> NOV. 5, 2009 </h5>

                <p>One good way to think about modern agriculture is to think about apples. For part of our history, culminating around the end of the 19th century, there was something about us — about our appetite, our farms, our economy — that loved diversity in apples. One standard reference, from 1905, lists more than 6,500 distinct varieties. There are apples for keeping, cooking, eating and the making of ciders, with names as colorful as they are various: Scollop Gillyflower, Red Winter Pearmain, Kansas Keeper.
                    Modern agriculture, as well as our carefully created preference for processed over fresh food, has pushed us in the opposite direction, toward uniformity. Apple production has been outsourced, driven to China like so much else. And even in formerly great apple-growing states, including New York, the number of different apples has greatly diminished. According to one estimate, only 11 varieties make up 90 percent of all the apples sold in this country, and Red Delicious alone counts for nearly half of that.
                    The good news is that apple trees don’t vanish when the harvest is over. Nor are they solely commercial. Every farmer, every homesteader in an apple climate, seems to have planted an apple tree. Many have been lost, but some still stand — old, overgrown trees producing long-forgotten varieties.
                    Researchers from the National Center for Genetic Resources Preservation have been studying genetic markers in 280 venerable apple trees growing on old farmsteads in the Southwest. Some came from commercial nurseries, others from agriculture experiment stations, but most were unique.
                    Those trees are an archive of apple diversity, holding out the possibility of preserving apple genotypes that might otherwise have vanished. But the research makes a broader point. If all that 19th-century apple diversity reflected different purposes and different needs, it also reflected a taste for difference. So the next apple you buy, think about all its hundreds and thousands of abandoned cousins. Think also of the agricultural biodiversity they represented; think, too, of the diversity of tastes that made them possible.
                    We live now in the world of the generic apple, in large part because our taste buds have gone generic. Cultivating ourselves is the first step toward rediversifying the fields and orchards around us.
